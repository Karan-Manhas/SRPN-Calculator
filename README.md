# SRPN-Calculator

Summary
I created a Saturated Reverse Polish Notation Calculator in Java.

What is reverse Polish notation?
Reverse Polish notation (RPN) is a method for representing expressions in which the operator symbol is placed after the arguments being operated on.
Saturated means that once a calculation reaches a specified value you stop and do not wrap around.

Code Execution
The code was compiled and ran in Replit.
